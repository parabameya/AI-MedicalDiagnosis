# Artificial Intelligence - Medical Diagnosis System


###Description:
The problems that are faced by patients are generally common and each and every time common solutions are given to them. If a patient is facing some new problem or some new symptom regarding a disease then the doctors need to think on every time and suggest some new medicines. So there should be a system which keeps track of the current and new symptoms and the medicines suggested against it so it can help saving time for future.

###Why It Is Important
It is important to store the data of all the cases in the past and also current ones so it easy to recollect data in case where there are similar symptoms. As the diseases is detected based on the symptoms , it plays a vital role to store the symptoms and help to solve the cases in future.

###Proposed Solution:
The System will be asking few questions to the patients regarding the symptoms, which are common, and being faced. Based on the symptoms which faced the knowledge store will check for past cases and one which has the maximum probability will we thrown as the maximum chances disease.

###Examples
1) UTD HEALTH CENTRE
In UTD Health center I had been treated for a wound so was able to have a good look at the system. It consisted of dynamic entries based on the options selected at time. E.g. The nurse selected the wound option then the system asked for the size of the cut. After the size was mentioned the system recommended that stitches were not necessary. She asked me for any allergies so the medicine to go for the wound treatment was suggested by the system.


###Data Set:
1. Diseases (apprx 4-6)
2. Symptoms/Disease (apprx 7-10)
3. Cases/disease (apprx 3-6)

###Techniques for Detection:
Naive Bayes Classification
Programming Tools:
* Eclipse SDK (JAVA SWIING)
* Eclipse to DB connectivity JAR file
* SQL SERVER
